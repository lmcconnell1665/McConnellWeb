## The Vlookup 2.0

The first step of becoming a master of Excel is learning how to use the Vlookup function.
While Vlookup remains one of the most popular functions in Excel, Xlookup is an upgraded version of this classic data insights tool.

&nbsp;

Xlookup allows you to input a unique identifier and return the corresponding information from a different column in a table.
A classic example would be to input an employee ID number and return that employeeâ€™s name.
The benefit of Xlookup is that the column that you want to be returned can be on the left or right of the unique identifier (where for Vlookup, the returned value had to be to the right of the unique identifier).

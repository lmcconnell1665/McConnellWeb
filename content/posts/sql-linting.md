## Introduction

R is a free and open-source coding language that is extremely popular for statistical computing, data mining, and machine learning.
This article walks you through the installation of R and R Studio (the most popular GUI for R) as well as the process for updating each.

&nbsp;

Getting R up and running is extremely easy.
I wanted to create an online location with all of these instructions as I find myself looking for the same resources every time I (or a student/colleague) need a new instance of R setup or updated.

***
## Step 1: Learn the example repo

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) keeps the latest versions of R stored in a network of mirrors.
[Navigate to the CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and find one of the mirrors located in the same country as you (so any of the USA locations for me).
[Here is a direct link](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/) to the mirror hosted by the National Institute for Computational Sciences in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

&nbsp;

Next, click the appropriate link to download R for either Mac, Windows, or Linux.
This will take you to a directory where you will want to select to download the most recent base version.
At the time of publishing, that is version 4.0.0.
Download the installation file on to your machine, run it, and walk through the steps.

## Step 2: Setup the pipeline in GitHub
Once you have completed step 1, R is on your computer and ready to be used.
R Studio is the most popular graphical user interface for R and makes working with the language and data much easier.
R Studio Desktop can be [downloaded for free with the open-source license here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
Once the installation file is on your machine run it and walk through the steps.
If you are on a Mac like I am, you will want to move the R Studio application to the Applications folder.

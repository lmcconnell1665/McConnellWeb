## 1. Artificial Intelligence & RPA (robotic process automation)
Using robotic process automation and pre-built AI models, we can automate processes like invoice and receipt data entry. Extracting data from non-structured sources like PDFs is becoming easier and is a great way to save someone from needing to do some very manual and boring data entry tasks. [This webinar shows how Power Automate can be used to build these tools into a workflow with little to no coding.](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-thankyou-documentprocessingaibuilder.html?LCID=EN-US&ocid=eml_pg290896_gdc_comm_ba)

## 2. Azure SQL Server Roles
Before this feature addition, the only way to access server level information for a logical Azure SQL Server was to be a full server admin. Now you can assign users, service principals, and groups specific server lever permissions without giving them full admin rights. [Read more about the new server roles here.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql/server-roles-for-azure-sql-database-database-management-without/ba-p/2714039)

## 3. Cloud Learning - John Savill's YouTube
John Savill has a YouTube channel centered around Azure that I've spent a lot of time watching. He recently began a DevOps "master class" that he has been adding to week by week that I've found detailed and helpful. I'd recommend any of the hundreds of videos he has posted related to Azure, DevOps, and other cloud computing tools. [Here's a link to the DevOps "master class" that he recently began curating.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nFr8RzQ4GIxUEznpNR53ERq)

> **Welcome to the Chattanooga IIA Chapter and friends!** Thanks for joining me for this CPE event. These are the links and materials related to the April 20th Power BI training. The goal of this training is to show how Power BI empowers business users to turn their data into insight. These materials are targeted towards users who have very minimal or no previous Power BI experience.
